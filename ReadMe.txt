Dependencies:
To execute code you do not need a GPU, but please make sure you have your dependencies â€”
python, numpy and matplotlib.pyplot.

Execution:
Please make sure you are in the /src directory.

$ python main.py

Evaluation focus:
- Training the feedforward neural network with normalized data using financial letter grade as a bench mark (1 being best and 5 being worst). Execute training with randomized bias and weights to see optimal accuracy with provided parameters. 

Evaluation data results:
- Cost decreased with every epoch and were able to achieve up to 30% accuracy on the validation set. 

Data set details:
- Training Data: 1250 random rows (each letter grade is represented at 250)
- Test Data: 60 random rows
- Validation Data: was not used in this implementation

Structure of files and folders is:
/src/network2.py
/src/mnist_loader.py
/src/main.py
/data/training_data.csv
/data/test_data.csv
/data/validation_data.csv (Please note we did not create validation data for this implementation.)
